# Dream and Consciousness

![Dream](/photos/DreamConsciousness.jpg)

i had deep dreams today. When i woke up i realized i was having a heavy dream. I could observe that the dream that i had today had some components of earlier dream. The dream had some influence of present events. The visuals and environment in the dream gets constructed as i progress in it. The characters in the dream could change from one scene to other. The consiousness fails to observe this change and continues as though everything is continious and nothingbis oit of place. When i woke up from the dream i could observe this change of characters and dicontinuity because of logic. In the dream there is a theme and logic is ignored. It amy be something like boiling of emottions that overlooks logic. Is there a part of brain that needs to be kept engaged this way so that body can relax and recover. The restoring of balance and cleansing could be carried out during this time.
